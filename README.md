# MultiCharApp

What was done:
- App created to display characters from TV Shows in a list
- Details screen navigation for comprehensive detail about the character
- For iPad uses a split view Controller to show list and detail together
- Created different target to deal with different URL's to display characters from different TV show
- Works for potrait and landscape configurations
- Wrote test cases (but are broken)
  
Needs to be done:
- Resolution of Navigation for better UX on iPad
- Fixing of broken test cases
